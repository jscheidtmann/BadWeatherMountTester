# Bad Weather Mount Tester

When you buy a new telescope mount, the first things to do is to measure the periodic error, because if the periodic error is really high, you would like to
complain and send it back as fast as possible. Unfortunately, most of the time there will be bad weather after buying astro gear for an indefinite amount of time.

**Bad Weather Mount Tester to the rescue!**

Using this program you can test the periodic error of your mount any time, any place, provided you have a spare computer and monitor and a little bit of space.
