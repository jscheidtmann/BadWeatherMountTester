What you need:

1. Your (new) mount, with your guiding gear and a computer attached to it (the Astro Computer)
2. A spare computer with monitor (the Simulator)
3. At least 5 m of space between them. (Ok, you can do with 3.5 m, but then accuracy will suffer)

This manual uses PHD2 as guiding program, but other guiding programs should provide similar functionality. You can use other guiding programs of your choice,
but you need to check how the given functionality of PHD2 is implemented in your software.
